## Tools used

### Pre-commit

To facilitate testing before committing, you have the option of running automated tests with pre-commit. Each hook enables a test that we can customize.

#### The main hooks configured

##### Linting

###### md-toc

To ensure an automatic generation of markdown *Table of content*, the `md-toc` hook is used.

#### Install dependencies

* [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

#### Usage Pre-commit

To execution automated on commit you can install pre-commit on your repo folder

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To perform code test manually, you must run the pre-commit before pushing your code
like this:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all
```

### Makefile

#### Install dependencies

* [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
